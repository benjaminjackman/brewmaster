Brewmaster, A groovy script based configuration framework for scala (and maybe java too)

Depends on:
Groovy
Google Guice

Motivation:
Programs are often structured as trees of components. Brewmaster makes configuring programs fashioned in this was a snap.
Brewmaster also allows for programs to be refreshed while running by changing the groovy script that started them, 
all changes will then be automatically propagated throughout the program.

For examples of uses explore the classes under the test folder.
